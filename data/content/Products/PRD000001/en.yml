  DecSpec1Content1: "PRODUCT OVERVIEW"
  DecSpec1Content2: "The T9 Smart Thermostat works with Smart Room Sensors to help you adjust the temperature from anywhere and stay cozy in the rooms that matter.                                            Place sensors where you want to see each room's temperature and humidity. Use the multi-room display on the thermostat's touchscreen  or in the Honeywell Home app  to focus on rooms based on occupancy or a specific schedule you choose. When focusing on multiple rooms, the T9 works toward creating an average temperature, balancing the needs across the whole home.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Whether its a song belted in the shower or a whispered secret, your air goes beyond simply carrying oxygen to circulating memories. Heavy or light, hot or cold, always unique to your home, the air you feel is more than its temperature setting.
